# Welcome to the Dev Home repo!

Dev Home is a new experience from Microsoft aiming to give developers more power on Windows.

This repository contains the source code for:

* [Dev Home](https://aka.ms/devhome)
* Dev Home core widgets

Related repositories include:

* [Dev Home GitHub Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/devhomegithubextension)
* [Dev Home Azure Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/devhomeazureextension)

## Installing and running Dev Home

> **Note**: Dev Home requires Windows 11 version 21H2 (build 22000) or Windows 10 version 22H2 (build 19045) or newer.

If you are running Windows 11 23H2 (build 22621.2361) or later, you can install and run Dev Home just by finding it in the Start menu.

Otherwise, you can install [Dev Home from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/devhome).
This allows you to always be on the latest version when we release new builds with automatic upgrades. Note that widgets may not work on older versions of Windows.

This is our preferred method.

### Other install methods

#### Via GitHub

For users who are unable to install Dev Home from the Microsoft Store, released builds can be manually downloaded from this repository's [Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/releases).

#### Via Windows Package Manager CLI (aka winget)

[winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) users can download and install the latest Dev Home release by installing the `Microsoft.DevHome` package:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.DevHome -e
```

## Dev Home overview

Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code:

### Dashboard

The Dev Home dashboard displays Windows widgets. These widgets are built using the Windows widget platform, which relies on Adaptive Cards.

### Machine configuration

The machine configuration tool utilizes the Dev Home GitHub Extension, but isn't required to clone and install apps. The app installation tool is powered by winget.

#### Popular apps

The machine configuration tool provides a list of popular apps when selecting applications to install. This is currently a hard-coded list of applications that have been popular with developers on Windows. Popularity was determined by high levels of installation and usage. As this is a moment in time, we are not accepting submissions for this list. We're looking to improve the experience with [Suggested Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/issues/375) so the list can be optimized for developers.
