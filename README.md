## Popular Apps

This is currently a hard-coded list of applications that have been popular with developers on Windows. Popularity was determined by high levels of installation and usage. As this is a moment in time, we are not accepting submissions for this list. We’re looking to improve the experience with [Suggested Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/issues/375)so the list can be optimized for developers.
