## Using the sample configurations
Download the *.dsc.yaml files to your local system. They can be executed in Dev Home via the "Machine configuration" section. They can also be executed by running `winget configure <path to configuration file>`.

Several DSC resources may require running in administrator mode. If the configuration is leveraging the [WinGet DSC resource](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.WinGet.DSC) to install packages, there are also limitations in some cases specific to the installers that may either require or prohibit installation in administrative context.

### GitHub projects (Repositories)
Sample configurations have been provided for various GitHub repositories. These configurations ideally should be placed in a `.configurations` folder in the root of the project directory. Some DSC resources may have parameters that allow you to pass in a relative file path. The reserved variable `$(WinGetConfigRoot)` can be used to specify the full path of the configuration file. An example of how to use that variable with a relative file path is shown below:

```yaml
    - resource: Microsoft.VisualStudio.DSC/VSComponents
      dependsOn:
      directives:
        description: Install required VS workloads from .vsconfig file
        allowPrerelease: true
      settings:
        productId: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Product.Community
        channelId: VisualStudio.17.Release
        vsConfigFile: '${WinGetConfigRoot}\..\.vsconfig'
```

### Learn to Code (Templates)
Sample configurations in this directory are directly related to the [Windows development paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-environment/#development-paths). These configurations will allow you to automatically set up your device and begin developing in your preferred language quickly.

### Sample DSC Resources (DscResources)
Examples for a few specific DSC Resources are under the [DscResources](./DscResources/) directory.

### Create your own
Writing YAML is a pain. To help you get started creating your own, there is a [sample tool](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create/blob/main/Tools/WingetCreateMakeDSC.ps1) for authoring in the winget-create repo. It currently only supports adding apps, but give it a try and contribute to make it better!
